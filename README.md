# Python-source-code-repository
Thank you for using our programing language interpreter
The way it works is as follows:
	For printing values just write it down and press enter
	For comments use # in the beginning of the comment.
	To write a function we define the function with the keyword â€“ FUN
	The structure of the function is: 
		FUN name(values)-> the code
	If statement are as follow: 
		IF boolean statement THEN do something ELSE do something
	To assign value to a variable : VAR variable name = value
	To run a script file the file should end with .lambda
	And the script must stand with the rules mention before
	To run simply open the terminal and run the following 
		python main.py your_file_name_here.lambda
